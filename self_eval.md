# Self Evaluation

### How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
- I feel pretty confident! Memorizing them is another thing
### How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
- I feel good about writing simple methods
### What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
- I'm unsure if I completed Question 4 in final_practice.rb properly. How do you take 3 strings and combine them into one string with spaces separating the words? Any guidance is greatly appreciated!
